# Magic Functions: What?
When you run a function \`Blah\` with backticks, the function is considered to be irreducible until all arguments are supplied (a Supercombinator TODO: link to supercombinator wiki page).
This function is not defined in Synbil source code. It's defined in some language that Synbil can link to, and it therefore is meaningless to partially evaluate it.


# Magic Functions: Why?
Magic Functions are how we run code that can be linked to, but that can't be written in the language.

Examples are things we need to be able to do fast and in an abstract way, like:
- Math
- Function application
- Runtime Reflection




# Magic Functions: How?
idk lmao
